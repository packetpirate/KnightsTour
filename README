Description:

The Knight's Tour is a game based on Chess. The goal of the game is to try to visit all 64 of the spaces on the Chess board using the Knight without revisiting a space you have already visited.

In this program, you start off at position (4,3) on the grid. Here is a key that will tell you what each character on the grid represents.

E = Empty, has not been visited yet.
X = Visited, cannot move here.
K = Knight
V = Valid move, the Knight can move here.

To move the Knight around, specify X and Y coordinates for the Knight to move to. The coordinates you specify must be marked with a V, or you will be unable to move there. The X and Y coordinates must each be between 0 and 7. So 0,0 would be the top left space, and 7,7 would be the bottom right.
